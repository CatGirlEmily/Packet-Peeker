# Packer-Peeker (1.21.10)
much simpler version of packetmanager. Allows you to view c2s packets (client-to-server) on in-game chat.
FABRIC API OBV REQUIRED (due to custom client-side commands)

# Usage
just type /packetpeek and you'll see the list of all avaible packets

# potential issues
noteworthy that these are only from play package, and from yarn 1.21.1 since i was too lazy to look through anything aside from docs on the internet.
in fact, i had to remove 3 of them due to already being outdated.
some of them will not work or are just sent on really specific occations. I will try to debug this later with chattriggers.

# when s2c
honestly i think it would take no more than two hours but i wanna go sleep now
